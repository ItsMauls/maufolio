export const ABOUT_ME = "Hello, I'm Maulana Ibrahim Adiputra, but you can call me Ibra. I'm a recent graduate from the Hacktiv8 bootcamp, where I immersed myself in various projects using different tech stacks within the JavaScript ecosystem. Prior to entering the IT field, I gained valuable skills such as time management and self-learning through freelance work. My desire to continuously learn and take on new challenges led me to the world of IT. I realize that working in IT provides me with opportunities to always learn and adapt quickly due to the rapidly evolving technology landscape every year."
